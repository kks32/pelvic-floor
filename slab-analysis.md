# Slab inner dimensions

> Large: 125.2 x 115.6

> Small: 110.9 x 91

## Slab aspect ratios and coeff k with fixed boundaries

> Large: Aspect: 1.083 k = 0.0387
> Small: Aspect: 1.2187 k = 0.0303


## Deflection assuming material and height are const
$$ w = k  * a^4 * q / (E * h^3)$$
> Large: f(k * a^4) = 0.0387 * 4.929^4 (inches) = 22.8426
 
> Small: f(k * a^4) = 0.0303 * 4.366142^4 (inches) = 11.01

Actual deflection observed is 26.2 mm (1.03")
